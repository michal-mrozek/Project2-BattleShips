## User Story Battleship Challenge

**As a** game enthusiast,

**I want to** play Battleship against an AI opponent,

**So that** I can test my strategic skills and enjoy the game even when I'm alone.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Game Setup:**
   - As a player, I want to be able to start a single-player game easily so that I can begin playing without any hassle.
   - The game should automatically generate ship placements for both me and the AI opponent.
   - I should have a clear view of my own grid and the AI opponent's grid, but not their ship placements.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - As a player, I want to take turns guessing coordinates to attack the AI opponent's ships.
   - I should receive immediate feedback on whether my guess was a hit or a miss.
   - The AI opponent should take turns making guesses to attack my ships.
   - The game should continue until either all my ships or the AI opponent's ships are sunk.

3. **User Experience (UX):**
   - The game interface should be user-friendly and visually appealing.
   - Visual cues should clearly indicate hits, misses, and sunken ships on both grids.
   - Controls should be intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy interaction with the game.

## Features
- **Single-player mode:** Play against a computer.
- **Randomly generated ship placement:** Each game starts with the ships being randomly placed on the grid.
- **Turn-based gameplay:** Player takes turns guessing coordinates to attack the opponent's ships.
- **Visual feedback:** The grid updates to show hits, misses, and sunken ships.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Intuitive Interface:** The game features a clean and intuitive interface designed for ease of use.
- **Responsive Design:** The game adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
   The Battleship game may not be designed for the smallest devices due to several reasons:

   1. Limited Screen Size: Smaller devices such as smartphones or small tablets have limited screen real estate. The Battleship game typically requires a grid-based interface, which may become cramped and difficult to navigate on smaller screens. Players may have difficulty accurately tapping or selecting grid coordinates, leading to a poor user experience.
   2. Complexity of Grids: Battleship games often feature grids with multiple rows and columns to represent the playing field. On smaller screens, displaying these grids with sufficient clarity and space for interaction can be challenging. Shrinking the grid to fit smaller screens may result in reduced visibility and difficulty distinguishing between grid cells.
   3. Touchscreen Controls: Many smaller devices rely on touchscreen controls for user interaction. While touchscreen controls are intuitive for certain types of games, they may not be well-suited for precise interactions required in Battleship, such as selecting individual grid coordinates or dragging ships into position. This can lead to frustration and inaccuracies during gameplay.
- **Clear Feedback:** Visual cues provide clear feedback on the game state, helping players understand their progress and next steps.
- **Accessible Controls:** Simple controls make it easy for players of all skill levels to enjoy the game without any barriers.
